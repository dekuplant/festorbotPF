## FestorBot (Yet Another DayZ Player Count Discord Bot)

Since YADPCDB is a terrible name for a project, we'll just call it *festor*.   The FesterBot is a stupid-simple
node-based discord bot that queries your DayZ server for game information and updates your discord channel
names to reflect the current player counts.

#### Discord Setup

First, invite the bot into your discord server.  We'll assume you know how this done.

Secondly, create the discord voice channels that the bot will be responsible for within your discord 
server.   Be sure that the bot has the permissions necessary for renaming those channels.  Make them voice 
channels instead of text channels to be able to use special characters such as slash and parenthesis. 

#### Bot Configuration

Simply rename the included `config.json.sample` to `config.json` and edit accordingly.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| BOT_TOKEN                 | Discord bot token to identify it on discord |
| PRESENCE_NAME             | Name of activity the bot is doing |
| PRESENCE_TYPE             | Type of activity the bot is doing (PLAYING, STREAMING, WATCHING, etc) |
| POLLING_INTERVAL          | How often (in seconds) to poll server for game info |
| SERVERS.NAME              | Name of this DayZ game server (a short name) |
| SERVERS.CHANNEL_ID        | The discord voice channel ID that will be renamed |
| SERVERS.ADDRESS           | The server address or IP of your DayZ game server |
| SERVERS.PORT              | Your DayZ steam query port (Game port also works) |

Note that the Discord API has a rate limit of 2 per 10 minutes in place for channel renaming.  For this reason, you 
shouldn't set the POLLING_INTERVAL to less than 2 or 3 minutes anyway because the discord channel will not be updated.
